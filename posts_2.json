People at school found out I was going to the gym and yet I was mocked but it still didn’t stop me from trying. \n\nWithin 5 months I was down 35KG in body weight and since then I never looked back since.

That’s the “secret.”\n\nYou can lose weight by slashing calories, sure!\n\nBut you won’t look strong. \n\nYou won’t feel energized.\n\nAnd you definitely won’t get that toned, lean look you’re after.\n\nBecause muscle is what shapes your body 💯 \n\nAnd protein is what feeds that muscle!\n\nIf you’re trying to get leaner, tighter, and more confident in your bathing suit, this is your wake-up call:\n\n🗣️You have to lift.

Plus, they’re a no bake recipe and so incredibly easy to make - so no excuses babe 🫶\n\nFor the base and topping:\n▫️ 200g oat flour\n▫️ 50g rolled oats\n▫️ 50g salted caramel / vanilla soy protein\n▫️ 1 tsp cinnamon\n▫️ 1/2 tsp salt\n▫️ 40ml maple syrup\n▫️ 2 tbsp milk\n▫️ 80g coconut oil, melted\n\nFor the middle:\n▫️ 200g dark chocolate\n▫️ 100g peanut butter\n\n1. Mix together all of the ingredients that will form the base and topping. The mixture should be slightly crumbly, but pack-down-able when you squeeze it between your fingers.\n2. Transfer 2/3 of the mixture into a lined 8x8 tin and pack it down evenly with your fingers or the back of a spoon. Pop the tin into the fridge while you get to melting the chocolate and peanut butter. \n3. Add the chocolate and peanut butter into a microwaveable bowl and heat in 30 second intervals, until melted and fully combined. Remove the tin from the fridge and pour the melted chocolate onto the base layer, spreading it to the sides with the back of a spoon. Crumble over the remaining 1/3 of the base mixture.\n4. Return the tin to the fridge for 1 hour. Then, slice up, and ENJOY!\n\nStore: in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days, or in the fridge for up to 10 days.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#healthysnack #homemade #healthybaking #oatbar #crumblebars #snackideas #sweettreat #highproteinsnack",

So today we’re makin’ our own. High protein, no weird ingredients, and pretty damn tasty for something so simple.\n\nFor the bagels:\n▫️ 125g self-raising flour\n▫️ 130g 0% Greek yoghurt\n▫️ 1/4 tsp salt\n\nFor the rest:\n▫️1 egg (for egg wash)\n▫️1 tsp white sesame seeds\n▫️1/2 tsp each of: black sesame seeds, garlic granules, onion granules, poppy seeds, flaky salt\n\nMethod:\n1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (fan).\n2. In a bowl, mix the flour, yoghurt, and salt with a spoon until it starts to come together.\n3. Use your hands to bring the dough together more, then tip onto a work surface.\n4. If it’s too wet, dust lightly with flour. If it’s too dry, dampen your hands and keep kneading.\n5. Once a smooth dough forms, divide into two pieces. Roll each into a thin log, then bring the ends together to form a bagel shape, pinching to seal.\n6. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle generously with everything bagel seasoning.\n7. Bake for 15–20 minutes, until golden.

Og pludselig så begyndte jeg at vokse.

Not only is it the best way to support me, but pre-orders are massively important for first-time authors as they help get the book stocked in more supermarkets and shops (eeek!). Plus, you won’t be charged a penny until it’s released in May.\n\nThank you so much @pavilionbooks and @harpercollinsuk for seeing my vision from the start and helping me bring this dream to life. But most importantly, thank you to each and every one of YOU. This book only exists because of your incredible support 🥺💓. When I made the decision last year to leave my career as a lawyer to follow my passion for food, I truly never imagined that this journey would lead to something like this, and it’s all thanks to you. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions at all, and I can’t wait to share more about this gorgeous book with you over the coming months 🧡",

Preheat oven to fan 180C.\n2. In a 9x6 baking dish (line if yours tends to stick), mash the bananas. Stir in the oats, protein powder, baking powder, and milk until fully combined. Smooth the top and clean down the sides. Bake for 35 minutes.\n3. Meanwhile, make the date caramel. Cover the pitted dates with boiling water and leave for 5 minutes. Transfer to a blender with the peanut butter, salt, and milk. Add 100ml of the reserved date water and blend until smooth, adding more water until you reach your desired consistency.\n4. Top the baked oats with dollops of yoghurt and caramel, swirl together, then add banana slices and grate over the chocolate.\n5. Cool for 5-10 minutes before slicing (this helps the squares hold their shape).\n6. Microwave a portion for 1 minute to warm it up, or enjoy cold for an oat-bar vibe. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.\nENJOY!\n\n*If you’re using a different protein powder, you may need to adjust the liquid.

I prayed for it, but deep down I was terrified it wasn’t possible.\n\nAnd then God placed you in my life when I wasn’t expecting it. You came in and changed everything in the best ways — loving me on the days I’m hard to love, showing me patience, reminding me what it feels like to be chosen, and stepping into Berk’s life in a way I’ll forever be grateful for.\n\nThis time last year I was texting you \"Happy Birthday\" from half way across the country without having any idea that this year I'd be getting to wake up next to you telling it to you in person.\n\nThis life is wild and unpredictable. It's scary but it's beautiful. And if I know one thing, it's that God works in ways we may never understand, but in all the ways we need.\n\nAnd he knew I needed you.\nHappy birthday to my best friend.

Mit fokus er dog primært at hjælpe dig med at træne målrettet og arbejde mod noget specifikt.\n\nStyrke og styrkeløft er min største spidskompetence. For eksempel hjalp jeg Louise fra aldrig at have squattet, bænket eller dødløftet til at vinde en bronzemedalje til Danmarksmesterskaberne.\n\nHybridtræning har jeg også stor erfaring med. Her har jeg blandt andet hjulpet Rasmus fra at løbe 5 km til at gennemføre en halv Ironman.\n\nDerudover elsker jeg at arbejde med personer, der “bare gerne vil blive bedre.” Mikkel er et godt eksempel – vi arbejdede sammen om at finde motivationen til at træne 3-4 gange om ugen. Da vi nåede det mål i efteråret, satte vi større mål for hans træning. For mig som træner er det rejsen, der virkelig tænder gnisten.\n\nHvis du overvejer, hvad du vil med din træning, så tøv ikke med at tage kontakt. Vi kan tage en uforpligtende samtale om, hvordan jeg kan hjælpe dig med at nå dine mål! 📈\n\n-\n#sejerdalum #teamsejertraining #personligtræner #personligtræning #styrkeløft #hybridathlete #træning",

  "caption": "Let’s chat ⬇️\n\nIf fat loss feels impossible, I get it—because I was right there too!\n\nAfter 35 (and two kids), I felt stuck. 😩 \n\nI was “eating clean,” doing endless cardio, and STILL not seeing the results I wanted. The scale wouldn’t budge, my energy was low, and I was frustrated AF.\n\nSound familiar? \n\n✅ First, LIKE & FOLLOW for daily fat loss + muscle-building tips.\n\n✅ Then, COMMENT “PLAYBOOK” for 5 FREE workouts + high-protein meal ideas!\n\nTurns out, I was skipping the things that actually move the needle.\n\n💡 Once I locked in these 5 NON-NEGOTIABLES, everything changed.\n\n1️⃣ I started prioritizing PROTEIN \n\nI used to barely eat 60g a day—no wonder I was always hungry! When I started aiming for at least 140g+ daily, I felt fuller, stronger, and actually started burning fat without losing muscle. \n\n2️⃣ I picked up the weights \n\nI thought more cardio = more fat loss. Wrong! Lifting 3-4x a week changed my body completely. More muscle = a faster metabolism. Less time working out, better results.\n\n3️⃣ I got serious about steps\n\nI used to think workouts were enough. They’re not. Daily movement outside the gym (8k-10k steps) made a HUGE impact without adding more stress.\n\n4️⃣ I STOPPED under-eating \n\nFor all my life, I thought eating less would get me lean. Reality check: Under-eating was slowing down my metabolism and making fat loss harder. When I fueled my body properly, I lost fat faster. And I stopped overeating to compensate for the times I ate like a bird \n\n5️⃣ I learned patience \n\nFat loss isn’t instant. As soon as I stayed on track and consistent—EVEN when the scale wasn’t moving—I saw real results.\n\n🌟 Once I truly committed to these 5 things, I lost 7% body fat and built a body I feel GOOD in. \n\nNo extreme diets, no starving, no endless workouts. Just smart habits that actually work.\n\n👋 I break it all down in my 140pg+ BLUEPRINT. The guide I wish I had when I started my fat loss journey. \n\nComment 🌟 BLUEPRINT 🌟 and I’ll send you a link to grab your copy!\n\n🫶 regina",
