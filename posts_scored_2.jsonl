Mit fokus er dog primært at hjælpe dig med at træne målrettet og arbejde mod noget specifikt.\n\nStyrke og styrkeløft er min største spidskompetence. For eksempel hjalp jeg Louise fra aldrig at have squattet, bænket eller dødløftet til at vinde en bronzemedalje til Danmarksmesterskaberne.\n\nHybridtræning har jeg også stor erfaring med. Her har jeg blandt andet hjulpet Rasmus fra at løbe 5 km til at gennemføre en halv Ironman.\n\nDerudover elsker jeg at arbejde med personer, der “bare gerne vil blive bedre.” Mikkel er et godt eksempel – vi arbejdede sammen om at finde motivationen til at træne 3-4 gange om ugen. Da vi nåede det mål i efteråret, satte vi større mål for hans træning. For mig som træner er det rejsen, der virkelig tænder gnisten.\n\nHvis du overvejer, hvad du vil med din træning, så tøv ikke med at tage kontakt.

The scale wouldn’t budge, my energy was low, and I was frustrated AF.\n\nSound familiar? \n\n✅ First, LIKE & FOLLOW for daily fat loss + muscle-building tips.\n\n✅ Then, COMMENT “PLAYBOOK” for 5 FREE workouts + high-protein meal ideas!\n\nTurns out, I was skipping the things that actually move the needle.\n\n💡 Once I locked in these 5 NON-NEGOTIABLES, everything changed.\n\n1️⃣ I started prioritizing PROTEIN \n\nI used to barely eat 60g a day—no wonder I was always hungry! When I started aiming for at least 140g+ daily, I felt fuller, stronger, and actually started burning fat without losing muscle. \n\n2️⃣ I picked up the weights \n\nI thought more cardio = more fat loss. Wrong! Lifting 3-4x a week changed my body completely. More muscle = a faster metabolism. Less time working out, better results.\n\n3️⃣ I got serious about steps\n\nI used to think workouts were enough. They’re not. Daily movement outside the gym (8k-10k steps) made a HUGE impact without adding more stress.\n\n4️⃣ I STOPPED under-eating \n\nFor all my life, I thought eating less would get me lean. Reality check: Under-eating was slowing down my metabolism and making fat loss harder. When I fueled my body properly, I lost fat faster. And I stopped overeating to compensate for the times I ate like a bird \n\n5️⃣ I learned patience \n\nFat loss isn’t instant. As soon as I stayed on track and consistent—EVEN when the scale wasn’t moving—I saw real results.\n\n🌟 Once I truly committed to these 5 things, I lost 7% body fat and built a body I feel GOOD in. \n\nNo extreme diets, no starving, no endless workouts. Just smart habits that actually work.\n\n👋 I break it all down in my 140pg+ BLUEPRINT. The guide I wish I had when I started my fat loss journey. \n\nComment 🌟 BLUEPRINT 🌟 and I’ll send you a link to grab your copy!\n\n🫶 regina", "llm_scores": {"scores": {"clarity": 5, "hook": 5, "value_delivery": 5, "cta": 5, "brand_fit": 5, "hashtag_use": 0, "compliance": 5, "language_fit": 5, "engagement_prompt": 5}, "overall_quality": 5, "rationale_short": "Excellent caption.
